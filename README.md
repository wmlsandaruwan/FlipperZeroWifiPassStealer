## How to create Discord Webhook
Step 1: Create a Discord Webhook
Open Discord and Navigate to Your Server:

Open Discord and select the server where you want to create the webhook.
Go to Server Settings:

Click on the server name at the top left to open the drop-down menu.
Select "Server Settings."
Select the "Integrations" Tab:

In the server settings, navigate to the "Integrations" tab on the left sidebar.
Create a Webhook:

In the "Integrations" tab, you’ll see a section called "Webhooks." Click on "Create Webhook."
Give your webhook a name and select the channel where the messages should be sent.
You can also customize the webhook avatar if you want.
Copy the Webhook URL:

After setting up your webhook, click "Copy Webhook URL." You’ll use this URL in your GitHub repository.
Step 2: Add the Webhook URL to Your GitHub Repository’s README
Open Your GitHub Repository:

Navigate to your repository on GitHub where you want to include the Discord webhook.
Edit the README File:

Click on the README.md file in your repository.
Click the pencil icon (✏️) to edit the file.
Add a Section for the Webhook:

In your README.md, create a section to include the Discord webhook information.
You might want to add a brief description or instructions on how to use the webhook.

## Notifications

This repository is connected to a Discord channel. You can use the following webhook URL to send updates or notifications directly to our Discord server:

**Discord Webhook URL:** `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-url`

Please make sure to use this webhook responsibly.
Save the Changes:

Once you’ve added the webhook information, scroll down, write a commit message, and click "Commit changes."
Step 3: Test the Webhook (Optional)
Test Sending a Message:
You can test the webhook by sending a simple HTTP POST request to the webhook URL using a tool like curl or Postman, or by integrating it into your CI/CD pipeline.
